	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm a second year cognitive science major at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>.I'm interested in the power of coding, whether it be through designing products, teaching computer science, or <a href="http://gunnoracle.com/2012/12/10/students-reach-semi-finals-in-siemens-national-science-competition/">applications of code to other disciplines</a>. Among other things, I am a <a href="http://throughtheeyesofcat.github.io">casual photographer</a> and sometimes <a href="http://instagram.com/onekitcat">Instagrammer</a>. I also play cello, and belong to a group called <a href="http://celli.berkeley.edu/about">Celli @ Berkeley</a>. In addition, I can read, write, and speak in Japanese. In my spare time, I like to read, swim, rock climb, cook, and write (code and non-code). </p>
