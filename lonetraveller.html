			<h1>WhisperGuide</h1>
			<p>WhisperGuide is an app designed to help travellers navigate offline by providing downloadable maps and tours, as well as social features for when travellers get back online. I worked with two other designers during the user research and brainstorming stages, and then delved deeper into one of my design concepts. 
			</p>
			<h2>Framing the Problem</h2>
			<p>Whenever I travel, I try to make do without international data, and therefore cannot rely on my smartphone to navigate. Unfortunately, I am also directionally challenged, so I have often gotten lost. Other people may or may not have the same problem. For example, my teammates described safety issues, boredom, hatred of packing, and social stigma against those who travel alone. So we decided to generalize and focus on the question: <b>How can young people have a better experience when travelling alone?</b></p>

			<h2>User Research</h2>
			<p>We defined "young people" as individuals 20-30 years old, who are more likely to be financially able and responsible enough to travel alone. We created a script to guide our interviews. Some of the questions we asked include asking users to describe their travel background, i.e. where they’ve travelled, if they knew the language, how often they’ve travelled, and whether the travel was on their own. We also asked what they liked and disliked about their experience, how they plan, as well as what apps and tools they use for travel. </p>

			<p>Based on our user research, a typical user:
				<ul>
					<li>Wants to prepare for local customs, but finds it hard. One interviewee said that in particular, she would like if locals could explain the customs to her. </li>
					<li>Dislikes planning for travel, but sees it as necessary</li>
					<li>Seeks out public wifi, and is limited by accessibility to the Internet</li>
					<li>Wants to meet other people to travel with, but finds it difficult due to language barriers</li>
					<li>Prefers eating with others </li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>After our user research, we jumped straight in to brainstorming. We wrote down key points from each of our interviews on individual Post-It Notes and grouped the Post-Its into categories. The colors indicate different teammates -- my color was yellow.
			</p>

			<br />
			<img src="images/lt_brain2.jpg">
			<p> We ended up with six categories, which include:
				<ul>
					<li>Technology/wifi: difficulties with limited access to wifi</li>
					<li>Meeting new people: desire to meet others</li>
					<li>Planning: frustrations with the process</li>
					<li>Customs: wanting to know more about the country</li>
					<li>Accomodations: finding places to stay </li>
					<li>Being alone: dislikes being alone</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>Using these categories as a guide, we brainstormed some ideas. We each voted for our top 3 choices. </p>
				<img src="images/lt_ideas.jpg">

			<p>Our top ideas, which we then separately created design assets for, are as follows:
				</p>
				<p><b>1. Data + Augmented Reality: Explore and collect data, Pokemon Go style </b><br/>
				An app which allows the traveller to collect data by going to certain monuments/places of interest. The traveller earns data bonuses for going to certain groups of monuments. <br />
				User needs addressed: Accessibility of data, spontaneous plan generation</p>
				<p>2. Voice Guide: A tour guide in your pocket (the idea I worked on, as illustrated above) <br />
				An app which would allow voice directions to be downloaded onto the traveller's phone beforehand. It features routes that involve the whole experience (i.e. which restaurants are good, points of interest). <br />
				User needs addressed: Accessibility of data, spontaneous plan generation, sharing customs</p>
				<p>3. Arrival Package: A travel care package <br />
				A service that provides a package that comes with essentials, key to booked hotel, travel tickets, etc. Also comes with a local guide who will explain customs. <br />
				User needs addressed: Spontaneous plan generation, sharing customs
				</p>
				<p>
				4. Match-up Pre- or live match-up  <br />
				An app which would notify the traveller when they are close to people who match what they want. This would be based on a "pre check-in" where the traveller posts what they want to do (i.e. eat with another person) at a location before getting there. <br />
				User needs addressed: Finding similar travelers, finding others to dine with</p>

			<h2>Concept Sketches</h2>
			<p>Here are my initial sketches for the audio travel guide.

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>After working on my concept sketch, I got some feedback on the design. I found out that there are actually similar apps in existence: <a href="https://www.detour.com/">Detour</a>, <a href="https://tripscout.co/">TripScout</a>, and <a href="http://pocketguideapp.com/">PocketGuide</a> seem to be the main ones. After downloading and trying out the apps, I noted the lack of social component beyond the ability to share on Facebook or rate tours, especially because everyone in our user group mentioned that they didn't like being alone and would like to meet new people when traveling. As a result, for the next stage, I decided to add these features: rating tours, user-created tours, and sharing photos and experiences of tours. </p>
