				<h1>VRoom</h1>
				<p>VRoom is a speculative virtual reality application which allows the user to experience a safe space whenever they need it, and which helps guide the user in becoming the person they wish to be. I worked in a group of three other designers.</p>

				<h2>Framing the Problem</h2>
				<p>At a competitive school like UC Berkeley, mental health is a major issue. While there are services available, often times, it is not enough due to the large student population. My teammates and I wanted to use our design skills to see what we could come up with to help with such issues.</p>
				<p>Because we are not mental health experts, we decided to focus on everyday issues that could impact mental health, rather than mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. One such area is how people deal with roadblocks in general. During early discussions, we came to the realization that how people deal with obstacles is likely due to their pasts. As such, we were interested in determining through interviews how people's pasts affect their present.</p>

				<h2>User Research</h2>
				<p>We chose to each interview one person (4 people total) in their 20s-30s about key objects and memories from their childhoods. We asked them to recall a key memory or object from their childhood and asked them a series of questions about how they thought it affected their current life. We also asked them about their current habits and how they overcome obstacles. Across all interviewees, we found common themes of <b>transitional objects</b> and <b>issues of confidence.</b> </p>

				<h2>Directed Background Research</h2>
				<p>After interviewing 4 people, we found that although there were some common themes, it was hard to figure out the answer to our initial research question. After all, lives are complicated. There may be many other reasons why people are the way they are that they themselves are not cognizant of. In order to augment our user interviews, we decided to do some online research relating to issues of confidence and transitional objects.<br/>
				<p>Here are the main topics we looked into. </p>
				<p><b>Transitional Objects</b>: Objects that children carry around with them to comfort themselves in difficult or unusual times. In our user interviews, these were the "key objects" that we asked about. Some of these objects included stuffed animals or something that they received when they were younger. Our interviewees still keep these items close at hand.</p>
				<p><b>Guided Image Therapy</b>: A therapy method used to direct one's concentration into visualizing a place or situation where one feels the most comfortable. It is mainly used to reduce stress and influence one's own behavior towards the positive. </p>
				<p><b>Law of Attraction</b>: The idea that we attract whatever we think about, both in the positive and negative sense. In the positive case, one is able to achieve success by believing that oneself can be successful.</p>

				<h2>Ideation</h2>
				<p>Based on our individual research, we each came up with an idea for how to synthesize our findings into a product. My idea was this VR system, but only for creating a "safe space". After brainstorming, we decided to incorporate details of each person's research and ideas.</p>

				<h2>Solution</h2>
				<p>VRoom is a VR application which uses <b>Brain Machine Interface (BMI)</b> in a speculative, "mind-reading" manner. The BMI, which would be part of the VR headset, reads in thoughts from the user, and generates questions tailored to the user. It would also allow for the user to imagine their <b>safe space</b> (the place where they feel the most safe/calm) and their <b>vision space</b> (their ideal life trajectory).</p>

				<h2>User Flow</h2>
				 <p>The user would have regular sessions with the device, and would follow a flow with the following stages: Vulnerability, Reflection, Clarity, and Vision. The user starts in an empty white room, and is guided through these stages.</p>

				 <ul><img src="images/start.png" alt="" id="centered"></ul><br />
				 <ul id="blist"><b>Vulnerability</b>: The user is prompted to think about a place that makes them happy. All the details they think of will be read by the BMI and based on this, the VR space will transform into their personalized safe space.</ul>
				  <ul><img src="images/reflection.png" alt="" id="centered"></ul>
				 <ul id="blist"><b>Reflection</b>: The user is prompted to think about how they are feeling in their safe space, and to describe their feelings. Within the VR space, the user is guided by a genderless avatar that listens to the user and provides feedback. This avatar would likely be a real-life therapist, or perhaps AI of the future. </ul>
				  <ul><img src="images/clarity.png" alt="" id="centered"></ul>
				 <ul id="blist"><b>Clarity</b>: The user is prompted through multiple thought-provoking questions to help the user gain better understanding of where they are and what they can do to reach their ideal self/life.</ul>
				  <ul><img src="images/vision.png" alt="" id="centered"></ul>
				 <ul id="blist"><b>Vision</b>: The user realizes what they should do to achieve the change they want after going through several clarity sessions. From the information the VR device receives via BMI from the user, a vision space is created.</ul>
