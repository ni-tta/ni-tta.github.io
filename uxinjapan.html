		<h1>UX Design in Japan</h1>
		<p>
			In Summer 2016, I interned at Mitsue-Links, Co., Ltd., a web design agency in Tokyo, and had the opportunity to learn about UX in Japan. Here I will describe the differences in design that I noticed during my internship. Due to agency policies, I cannot discuss specific projects or details about those projects, so I will use illustrative examples.
		</p>
		<h2>"Bad" Design?</h2>
		<p>
			As someone who has grown up in the United States, I was surprised by the design of Japanese webpages. Jam-packed with information, Japanese websites can be overwhelming. Here is an example. 
		</p>

		<p> 
			Coming from a Western design viewpoint, the Starbucks Japan webpage makes several design "mistakes", including:
			<ul>Elements densely packed together</ul>
			<ul>Lots and lots of small text</ul>
			<ul>Headers do not use any differentiation from content text</ul>
			<p>However, this type of design is commonplace in Japan. Why is this the case? </p>
		</p>
		<h2> The Reasons for Differences in Design in Japan</h2>
		<p> 
			During the course of my internship, I was involved with projects in which overseas web services wanted to expand into Japan, as well as projects in which domestic web services wanted to improve their usability. These projects helped me understand the underlying motivations behind the designs of Japanese websites. I found that the reasons were divided into roughly three categories: consumer behavior, societal factors, and language differences. 
		</p>
		<h3> Consumer behavior </h3>
		<p>
			Japanese users tend to be cautious about unfamilar products. An overseas client attempting to enter the Japanese market wanted to test their app on Japanese users. Most participants in the user study said that if they were going to download the app, they wanted to know if it was trustworthy, either through friends/family speaking positively about the app, or by popularity rankings. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			Continuing on the theme of trust, Japanese users found overseas websites to be lacking in information. What does this mean? Here I will give Pandora's premium plan page as an example.
		</p>
		<img src="images/pandora.png">
		<p class ="caption"><a href="https://www.pandora.com/premium">(pandora.com/premium</a>, August 2016)</p>
		<p> A similar page to this was shown to Japanese users in a user study. Like Pandora, the service had both free and premium plans, as well as a free trial of the premium version. The client had a similar page to show users, in order to determine how to attract potential subscribers. However, most of the participants responded that they would probably not start using the service. Why? Because the premium features were not made clear enough. For some features, users wanted the technical specs, and for other features, users wanted description of what the features are supposed to do. </p>
		<p> On the Pandora site, for example, users would probably want objective details on what "higher quality audio" entails, i.e. how it was measured. They would probably want to know what features such as "skip" or "replay" are supposed to do, which may not be universal features understood by all. Also, users would probably want to know more about whether payment details are required upfront. Users wanted such information to be given either on the same page, or an easily accessible link to learn more. Similarily, on other occasions, when shown landing pages with minimal text, large photos and/or use of white space, users wondered where they could get more information.
		</p>
	
		<p> 
			So in other words, Japanese sites tend to show as much information as possible on the front page, as a way to invite trust. The idea in Japan is that services and companies should not hide what they are doing. 
		</p>

		<h3>Societal Factors</h3>
		<p>
			If you commute by train in Tokyo, in addition to the crowdedness and silence, you would probably notice all the people with their phones out. Perhaps this is not a strange image these days, but it was true even before the advent of the smartphone. 
		</p>

		<h3>Language differences</h3>
