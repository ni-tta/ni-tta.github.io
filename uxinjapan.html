		<h1>UX Design in Japan</h1>
		<p>
			In Summer 2016, I interned at Mitsue-Links, Co., Ltd., a web design agency in Tokyo, and had the opportunity to learn about UX in Japan. Here I will describe the differences in design that I noticed during my internship. Due to agency policies, I cannot discuss specific projects or details about those projects, so I will use illustrative examples.
		</p>
		<h2>"Bad" Design?</h2>
		<p>
			As someone who has grown up in the United States, I was surprised by the design of Japanese webpages. Jam-packed with information, Japanese websites can be overwhelming. Here is an example. 
		</p>

		<p> 
			Coming from a Western design viewpoint, the Starbucks Japan webpage makes several design "mistakes", including:
			<ul>
				<li>Elements densely packed together</li>
				<li>Lots and lots of small text</li>
				<li>Headers do not use any differentiation from content text</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, this type of design is commonplace in Japan. Why is this the case? </p>
		</p>
		<h2> The Reasons for Differences in Design in Japan</h2>
		<p> 
			During the course of my internship, I was involved with projects in which overseas web services wanted to expand into Japan, as well as projects in which domestic web services wanted to improve their usability. These projects helped me understand the underlying motivations behind the designs of Japanese websites. I found that the reasons were divided into roughly three categories: consumer behavior, societal factors, and language differences. 
		</p>
		<h3> Consumer behavior </h3>
		<p>
			Japanese users tend to be cautious about unfamilar products. An overseas client attempting to enter the Japanese market wanted to test their app on Japanese users. Most participants in the user study said that if they were going to download the app, they wanted to know if it was trustworthy, either through friends/family speaking positively about the app, or by popularity rankings. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			Continuing on the theme of trust, Japanese users found overseas websites to be lacking in information. What does this mean? Here I will give Pandora's premium plan page as an example.
		</p>
		<img src="images/pandora.png">
		<p class ="caption"><a href="https://www.pandora.com/premium">(pandora.com/premium</a>, August 2016)</p>
		<p> A similar page to this was shown to Japanese users in a user study. Like Pandora, the service had both free and premium plans, as well as a free trial of the premium version. The client had a similar page to show users, in order to determine how to attract potential subscribers. However, most of the participants responded that they would probably not start using the service. Why? Because the premium features were not made clear enough. For some features, users wanted the technical specs, and for other features, users wanted description of what the features are supposed to do. </p>
		<p> On the Pandora site, for example, users would probably want objective details on what "higher quality audio" entails, i.e. how it was measured. They would probably want to know what features such as "skip" or "replay" are supposed to do, which may not be universal features understood by all. Also, users would probably want to know more about whether payment details are required upfront. Users wanted such information to be given either on the same page, or an easily accessible link to learn more. Similarily, on other occasions, when shown landing pages with minimal text, large photos and/or use of white space, users wondered where they could get more information.
		</p>
	
		<p> 
			So in other words, Japanese sites tend to show as much information as possible on the front page, as a way to invite trust. It seems idea in Japan is that services and companies should not hide what they are doing. One non-web example of this is the use of highly realistic plastic food "samples" in front of restaurants to give potential customers an idea of the food offerings. Below is an example. 
		</p>

		<h3>Societal Factors</h3>
		<p>
			If you commute by train in Tokyo during rush hour, probably first you would notice the crowdedness, as well as the almost deathly silence. But you would probably also notice all the people with their phones out. Perhaps this is not a strange image these days, but it was true even before the advent of the smartphone. 
		</p>

		<p>Even before the smartphone, Japanese users were accessing the web on their mobile phones. In order to get webpages to fit on those small screens, skinny columns were needed. Below is the mobile version of the Starbucks Japan website from earlier.</p>
		<div class="portrait">
		<img src="images/sb_mobile1.png">
		<img src="images/sb_mobile2.png">
		</div>
		<p class="caption"><a href="http://www.starbucks.co.jp/">(starbucks.co.jp</a>, August 2016)</p>
		<p>With the mobile version of the site, each of the columns becomes a separate section, and it is a lot less visually busy. The image that was on the left is shown completely on its own as a hero image. When seen on mobile, the Starbucks Japan webpage may have more visible information than Western websites, but is overall quite close to many Western mobile websites. It is as if websites are designed for mobile and then web, rather than the other way around.</p>

		<h3>Language differences</h3>
		<p>Japanese uses Chinese characters called kanji in writing. It is a writing system that is highly complex compared to the English alphabet. It also tends to take up less space to convey meaning than English does. </p>
		<p>For example, my Japanese name is "Ai", and writing out Ai Nitta takes 7 letters in English, but takes just 3 characters in Japanese: 新田愛. 

		With these characters, you might notice that there is a lot going on within each character. Whereas most English characters can be written in 1-3 strokes, that is rare for kanji characters. </p>

		<h2>User Research Differences</h2>
		<p>I don't think there is much of a difference in the general user research process used in Japan vs. the United States. After meeting with stakeholders, a research plan is created, users are recruited, a script is written, and user interviews are conducted using a variety of standard methods. </p>
		<p>However, generally speaking, there are differences in the approach to questions. Questions need to be direct. The "warm-up" icebreaker questions that tend to get asked at the beginning of user interviews in the U.S. generally do not have a place in Japan. Those types of questions are reserved for more social settings. </p>

		<h2>The Future of Design in Japan</h2>
		<p>Although I talked about Japanese websites that are visually loud in comparison to Western websites, not all Japanese websites are like that. Some newer companies, or companies that are popular abroad, have sleeker websites. For example, here is site.</p>


		<p>Other companies have a Japanese version and an international version in English, off of which other country's webpages are based. Here is an example. </p>

		<p>In fact, the agency I interned at generally goes for the more minimalistic and modern designs seen in the West. </p>
