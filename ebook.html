			<h1>Improving the eBook Experience</h1>
			<p>
				I got into a conversation with an acquaintance about the digital reading experience, which got me interested in thinking about eBooks from a user experience perspective. My goal in this project was to improve the experience of reading eBooks to more closely resemble the experience of reading a physical book.
			</p>
			<h2>User Research</h2>
			<p>I interviewed five people between the ages of 25 and 35. I asked them questions pertaining to their reading habits and preferences.</p>
			<p>Here are some of the questions I asked.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>How do you read books? (hard copy, ebook reader, app, audio, etc.)</li>
				<li>How often do you read? What factors affect how often you read?</li>
				<li>Why do you read?</li>
				<li>What medium do you use the most often to read books? Why?</li>
				<li>What is your favorite medium to read books on? Why? </li>
				<li>Do you tend to buy books or borrow them? Why? </li>
				<li>How do you find new books to read?</li>
				<li>Have you ever used an eBook reader? What did you like about it? What did you dislike about it? How about reading online? </li>
			</ul>
