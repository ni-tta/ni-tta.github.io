			<h1>Improving the eBook Experience</h1>
			<h2>The Problem</h2> 
			<p>
				Reading is one of the things I enjoy doing in my free time. Due to convenience, I read books on my Kindle or on my iPhone. Personally speaking, I donâ€™t have much issue with the experience of reading books digitally, except for perhaps eye strain, which limits the time I can read daily. However, I got into a conversation with an acquaintance about the digital reading experience, which got me interested in thinking about eBooks from a user experience perspective. My goal in this project was to improve the experience of reading eBooks to more closely resemble the experience of reading a physical book.
